## Packages
recharts | For dashboard statistics charts (gender, pregnancy distribution)
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and micro-interactions
date-fns | For date formatting and manipulation

## Notes
Authentication uses Replit Auth (via /api/auth endpoints)
The app supports RTL layout conceptually, but we will build LTR by default with RTL-friendly structure.
Images will use Unsplash for placeholders where appropriate.
Theme will be health-oriented (Teal/Blue/Green).
